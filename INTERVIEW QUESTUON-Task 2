1. What is the purpose of EDA?
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) helps you:
Understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in your data
Spot missing values, outliers, and data imbalances
Make decisions on cleaning, transforming, or dropping features

2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?
Boxplots show:
Median (central tendency)
Quartiles (spread)
Outliers (extreme values)

3. What is correlation and why is it useful?
Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables (ranges from -1 to +1).
I used a correlation matrix to identify:
Positive correlation between Fare and Survived
Negative correlation between Pclass and Survived This helped prioritize features for modeling.

4. How do you detect skewness in data?
Visually: using histograms or boxplots
Statistically: using .skew() method in pandas
In Titanic, Fare was heavily right-skewed, which made it important to consider for scaling or transformation before modeling.

5. What is multicollinearity?
Multicollinearity is when two or more independent features are highly correlated with each other. It can:
Confuse models (especially linear regression)
Inflate variance of coefficients
You can detect it using:
Correlation matrix
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

6. What tools do you use for EDA?
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
pandas, numpy → for data handling
seaborn, matplotlib → for visualization
scikit-learn → for preprocessing
I used all of these in my Titanic EDA project.

7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?
Yes! In the Titanic dataset:
EDA revealed that Fare had severe outliers
Also found missing values in Embarked and Age Without EDA, I would have trained a model with noisy, incomplete data.

8. What is the role of visualization in ML?
Visualization helps you:
Understand feature distributions
Detect outliers, skewness, missing data
Communicate findings clearly
